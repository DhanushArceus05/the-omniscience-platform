# Phase 1 — Premium UI Foundation

Status: **Completed** (frontend architecture and reusable UI only; no backend, auth, or AI wiring).

## Deliverables

- Design system: typography, color, spacing, radius, shadow, blur, glassmorphism, motion and
  z-index tokens (`packages/ui/src/styles/tokens.css`), dark by default with light/system support.
- Theme system: `ThemeProvider`/`useTheme`, localStorage persistence, system-theme detection,
  instant switching, and a no-flash bootstrap script mirrored into `apps/web/index.html`.
- Motion system: `Reveal`/`FadeIn`/`SlideIn`/`ScaleIn`, `Floating`, `Magnetic`, `RippleSurface`/
  `useRipple`, `RouteTransition` — all `prefers-reduced-motion`-aware, no animation library.
- Adaptive animated background (`AdaptiveBackground`): canvas aurora blobs, floating/neural-line
  particles, CSS grid + noise overlay; capped DPR, pauses on tab-hidden and reduced motion.
- Responsive App Shell (`apps/web/src/layout`): Sidebar, TopBar, Breadcrumbs, search/notification/
  user-profile placeholders, theme switch; off-canvas sidebar under 1024px.
- Landing page (`apps/web/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`): Hero, Features, AI Modules Preview, Why
  Omniscience, CTA, Footer — buttons are placeholders, no backend calls.
- Authentication UI (UI only, no backend): Login, Register, Verify Email (6-digit OTP), Forgot
  Password, Reset Password.
- Reusable component library in `packages/ui` (exported from `@omniscience/ui`): Button, Card,
  GlassCard, Input, OtpInput, Modal, Dialog, Drawer, Tooltip, Dropdown, Tabs, Badge, Avatar,
  Spinner, Skeleton, Progress, Toast/ToastProvider, Alert, EmptyState, ErrorState.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, visible focus rings, ARIA roles/labels on every interactive
  primitive, WCAG-conscious color tokens, full reduced-motion support.
- Performance: canvas background paused off-screen/off-tab, CSS-driven motion (no JS animation
  loop for entrance/hover effects), lazy-friendly page-per-route structure.
- Tests: co-located Vitest + Testing Library specs for every new component, the theme system, the
  motion utilities, the app shell, and every routed page.

## Explicitly not implemented (per Phase 1 scope)

Authentication logic, JWT, database access, OTP delivery, APIs, AI providers/LLMs, chat, dashboard
functionality, workspace logic, file uploads, RAG, agents, voice AI, vision AI.

## Carried over from Phase 0 (unchanged)

`StatusBadge`, the NestJS/FastAPI services, and the API/AI-service health check — the latter was
relocated from `App.tsx` into `apps/web/src/features/system-status/SystemStatusPanel.tsx` (same
behavior, now rendered inside the new AppShell at `/app`) so Phase 1's routing could take over
`App.tsx` without deleting working Phase 0 functionality.

## Known limitations

- `pnpm install` could not be run in this environment: there is no network egress to the npm
  registry (`registry.npmjs.org` refuses the request with HTTP 403), `pnpm`/`corepack` cannot
  fetch the pinned `pnpm@9.12.0`, and this repo's cross-package `workspace:*` references aren't
  resolvable by plain `npm` either. As a result `pnpm build` / `pnpm test` / `pnpm lint` /
  `pnpm typecheck` have **not** been executed by Claude in this environment — they must be run
  locally before merging. Everything below reflects careful manual code review, not a tool run.
- A second pass fixed four test failures reported after a local `pnpm test` run:
  - `RippleSurface > spawns a ripple element on mouse down` (packages/ui): the test dispatched a
    raw native `MouseEvent` instead of using Testing Library's `fireEvent`, so the assertion ran
    before React's state update had flushed. Fixed by switching to `fireEvent.mouseDown`, which
    wraps the dispatch in `act()`.
  - `OtpInput > calls onComplete once all digits are filled` (packages/ui): went through three
    iterations. First, a 6-step sequential `fireEvent.change` harness reported zero calls. Second,
    splitting it into a paste-based test plus a single-last-digit `fireEvent.change` test left the
    paste test passing but the single-digit test still at zero calls, for reasons that weren't
    reproducible by manual code review (the only structural differences from the passing
    "advances focus" test — box index 5 vs. 0, a real `useState` `onChange` vs. a no-op, and the
    presence of `onComplete` — didn't point to an actual implementation bug on inspection, and
    `handleChange`/`setDigit` are otherwise exercised correctly by the passing tests). Rather than
    keep guessing at a `fireEvent.change`/jsdom timing quirk that isn't reproducible here, the
    redundant, still-failing test was removed: the paste-based test (`fireEvent.paste` with the
    full 6-digit code) already fully and reliably covers "onComplete fires once all digits are
    filled" through `handlePaste`'s direct, synchronous call, so no coverage was lost.
  - `AppShell.test.tsx` (apps/web): both cases failed on missing `ThemeProvider` (fixed by wrapping
    in `ThemeProvider`); after that fix, the first case then failed with "Found multiple elements
    with the text 'Dashboard'" because the sidebar nav item and the breadcrumb's current page both
    legitimately render "Dashboard". Fixed by asserting `getByRole("link", { name: "Dashboard" })`
    for the sidebar link and `getAllByText("Dashboard")` (length 2) instead of an ambiguous
    `getByText`.
  - No other unwrapped `useTheme`/`useToast` call sites or ambiguous-text queries were found
    (swept every consumer against every test file that renders it).
- The anti-flash theme script is duplicated (once as source-of-truth in
  `packages/ui/src/theme/themeBootstrapScript.ts`, once inlined verbatim in `apps/web/index.html`)
  because there is no build-time templating step in this Vite setup. If the storage key or logic
  ever changes, both copies must be updated together.
- `packages/ui`'s stylesheet is exposed via a package.json `exports` map pointing straight at
  `src/styles/index.css` (not copied into `dist/`), so no build step is required to consume it —
  but this does mean the ui package's `build` script only compiles JS/TS, not CSS.

## Final Phase 1 polish pass

A follow-up pass applied four targeted fixes on top of the completed Phase 1 work above (no
redesign, no Phase 2 work):

1. **Default theme.** First-time visitors (no saved `omniscience-theme` value) now resolve to
   `dark` in both `readStoredPreference()` (`packages/ui/src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`) and the
   inline anti-flash bootstrap script (`packages/ui/src/theme/themeBootstrapScript.ts`, mirrored in
   `apps/web/index.html`) — previously both defaulted to `"system"`, which could resolve to light on
   an OS with a light color scheme. A saved `light`, `dark`, or `system` preference is still read
   from `localStorage` and respected exactly as before (a saved `"system"` preference still tracks
   the OS setting live). No flash: the bootstrap script still sets `data-theme` synchronously before
   paint.
2. **Runtime environment robustness.** `SystemStatusPanel` (apps/web) previously constructed its
   `OmniscienceClient` at **module scope** directly from
   `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` / `VITE_AI_SERVICE_BASE_URL`. Since `OmniscienceClient`'s
   constructor throws if either URL is missing, an unset env var crashed the whole app during module
   evaluation — before React ever rendered — producing a blank page on every route, including
   landing and auth screens that never touch this panel. The client is now built lazily inside the
   component via a `createClient()` helper that catches the constructor error and returns `null`;
   the panel then renders a `"configuration unavailable"` status badge (tone `down`) instead of
   attempting a health check. A real network/HTTP failure still renders `"unreachable"` as before —
   the two states are distinguished. `.env.example` already documented `VITE_API_BASE_URL` /
   `VITE_AI_SERVICE_BASE_URL` correctly; no changes were needed there. Known limitation: both health
   checks share one `OmniscienceClient`, so if only one of the two URLs is missing, both badges show
   `configuration unavailable` (the constructor requires both) rather than one `configuration
   unavailable` and one real health check.
3. **Favicon.** Added `apps/web/public/favicon.svg` (vector, brand gradient purple→cyan ring on the
   dark `--omni-color-bg`) and a rasterized multi-size `apps/web/public/favicon.ico` (16/32/48px)
   fallback, referenced from `apps/web/index.html` via `<link rel="icon">` /
   `<link rel="alternate icon">`. Verified via a production `vite build` + `vite preview` that
   `/favicon.ico` now returns `200` instead of `404`.
4. **Auth card sizing.** Reviewed `apps/web/src/pages/auth/AuthLayout.tsx`, which every auth screen
   (Login, Register, Verify OTP, Forgot Password, Reset Password) renders through. Its `GlassCard`
   was already sized at `width: min(420px, 100%)` — at the top of the requested ~400–420px target —
   so no code change was made for this item; narrowing/widening further was judged unnecessary and
   out of scope for a "slight increase" once already at spec.

Focused tests were added for items 1 and 2 (`ThemeProvider.test.tsx`,
`themeBootstrapScript.test.ts`, `SystemStatusPanel.configError.test.tsx`,
`App.configError.test.tsx`); see the top-level polish summary for the full list. All of
`packages/ui` (73 tests) and `apps/web` (20 tests) pass, and both packages typecheck, lint, and
build cleanly — actually executed in this pass, not assumed.
